Unity FPS/TPS Character Controller
A versatile and robust character controller built in Unity, featuring both First-Person (FPS) and Third-Person (TPS) perspectives. This project serves as a solid foundation for creating action, adventure, or shooter games.

Movement: Standard walk, sprint, and jump capabilities.

Crouching: Dynamic crouching with smooth height transitions.

Obstacle Detection: Prevents the player from standing up while under an obstacle.

Stable Ground Check: Uses a robust SphereCast to reliably detect ground, preventing flickering on slopes and uneven surfaces.

Animator Ready: Includes all necessary parameters to easily hook up animations for idle, walk, run, jump, and crouch states.

Third-Person (TPS) Controller
Camera-Relative Movement: The player character smoothly rotates and moves relative to the camera's direction.

Cinemachine Integration: Utilizes Cinemachine FreeLook cameras for dynamic, professional-grade camera control.

Aiming System: A simple state-driven camera system for an over-the-shoulder aiming view.

First-Person (FPS) Controller
